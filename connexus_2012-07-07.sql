	(3,'','John Ringo','John Ringo is a New York Times bestselling author of science fiction and thriller novels with over one million novels in print.  John Ringo had visited 23 countries and attended 14 schools by the time he graduated high school. This left him with a wonderful appreciation of the oneness of humanity and a permanent aversion to foreign food.  The author chose to study marine biology and really liked it. Unfortunately the pay is for beans. So he turned to database management where the pay was much better. His highest hopes were to someday upgrade to SQL Server at which point, he thought, his life would be complete. But then Fate took a hand: John became a professional science fiction writer and since his publisher assured him that all science fiction authors became immensely successful, he was given the standard \"rich and famous\" contract. Somewhat confused by the fine print, he nonetheless signed in blood. \r\nSince that fateful day, he has published numerous science fiction novels at a rate that amazed and offended his publisher, who hadn\'t intended him to get that rich and famous. With over a million copies in print, he also has done stints as an op-ed writer for the New York Post and a guest commentator for Fox News, thus ensuring the loss of what little soul was left.  With his younger years spent in the Airborne, cave diving, rock-climbing, rappelling, hunting, spear-fishing and sailing, the author is now happy to let other people risk their necks. He prefers to read, and of course write, science fiction, hang out in cigar bars and look for new ways to pledge his remaining bits of soul. He\'s thinking... Hollywood... They won\'t care if it\'s tarnished... \r\n','','Author',12),

Any spot in my school notebooks that didn\'t have notes were filled with sketches. I drew mostly from the D&D adventures that my brother ran, as well as the fantasy books I was reading. I did a few pieces based on Terry Brooks\' Shannara series, but focusing on being a nerd, I didn\'t have much time for art in high school.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to college I dual majored in Computer Science and Art History. I minored in Studio Art, and took as many art classes as my schedule allowed. I seemed to be pursuing a career in art or art education, but decided to try graduate school in Computer Science. I graduated in 2004 with a Master\'s in CS, but again switched paths and returned to my art interests. Mike, my brother, and I co-own Aradani Studios, a costuming and art company that we founded in 2002. We travel mostly in the Southeast United States, to various conventions and Renaissance Festivals, selling our art, and our ears.\r\n\r\nI currently call Nashville, TN my home, and don\'t see that changing for quite some time. This is where my friends, my family, and my career is. When I first posted this bio, I said that, \"I still have no idea what I want to do with my life.\" Well, in those 4 years that I wrote that, I think I have found my calling. At the age of 26, I won the most prestigious fantasy art award there is, the Chesley Award. Mike and I have slowly but steadily grown this business into something that now employees other people! And most importantly, I love what I do, and I truly enjoy being able to talk about my art with people, and have a dialogue with them.\"\r\n','','Artist',12),

Perhaps influenced by a somewhat similar use of Belisarius (circa 505-565) in Lest Darkness Fall (December 1939 Unknown; exp 1941; rev 1949) by L Sprague de Camp, the series focuses on the historical Byzantine general who is here given anachronistic knowledge in order that he might combat attempts to alter history in a Changewar dominated by an inimical AI from a wrong future. His second series of interest - the 1632 sequence, which in 2006 became retroactively the main existing sub-set of the Assiti Shards Series, with other sub-sets awaiting publication - is partly solo, partly collaborative. In the first instalment, 1632 (2001), a small American town called Grantville is transported via Timeslip to the Germany of 1631, and over the next year its modern-day inhabitants transform their new world in order to fight off the depredations of the Thirty Years\' War. Further volumes include 1633 (2002) with David Weber, Ring of Fire (anth 2004), 1634: The Galileo Affair (2004) with Andrew Dennis and its immediate sequel, 1634: The Cannon Law (2006) with Andrew Dennis, 1634: The Ram Rebellion (2006) with Virginia DeMarce, 1634: The Baltic War (2007) with David Weber and 1634: The Bavarian Crisis (2007) with Virginia DeMarce, with various continuations scheduled under the Assiti Shards umbrella. Much of the contents of various iterations of the Grantville Gazette relate to this sequence as a Shared-World enterprise, whose overall tenor has been criticized for ethnocentricity; it takes an optimistic bent on the nature of progress.\r\nOther series include the Rats, Bats and Vats sequence beginning with Rats, Bats and Vats (2000) with Dave Freer; the Joe\'s World series beginning with The Philosophical Strangler (2001); the Heirs of Alexandria books, beginning with The Shadow of the Lion (2002) with Mercedes Lackey, and connected to his collaborator\'s Merovingian Nights Shared World; plus contributions to other shared enterprises. The Wizard of Karres (2004) with Dave Freer and Mercedes Lackey is a Sequel by Other Hands to James M Schmitz\'s The Witches of Karres (December 1949 Astounding; exp 1966).\r\nOf Flint\'s singletons, only the first (see above) and 1824: The Arkansas War (2006) are solo. He has also edited collections of the work of Christopher Anvil, Randall Garrett, Tom Godwin, Keith Laumer, Murray Leinster, Howard L Myers and James M Schmitz, sometimes with collaborators. Flint has become one of the few twenty-first-century sf authors of any influence whose voice could be described as uplifting as regards the human enterprise; it is a welcome (though at times slightly strained) tone.

I\'ve been writing most of my long and wicked life, getting paid for it in the non-fiction category for something like twenty-five years, and writing fantasy and science fiction professionally since my first professional sale in 1992. (A story called \"Yearbride\" to Marion Zimmer Bradley for the *Snows of Darkover* anthology.) Since then, my work has appeared in such places as three volumes of the *Sword and Sorceress* antho series, *Turn The Other Chick*, Selina Rosen\'s *Bubbas of the Apocalypse* series, and numerous other anthologies and online venues. For the complete bibliography and what\'s in the pipeline, check out \"Teller of Tales\" on the HarpHaven website, http://www.Harphaven.net/\r\nFor twelve years, I edited a size-issues activism magazine called *Rump Parliament*, which focused on working to change the way society treats fat people and served as a gathering point for people interested in learning and practicing effective activism against weight discrimination. A compilation of editorials and essays from those twelve years has just been released under the title *Prejudice By The Pound: Essays From The Size Rights Movement*.\r\nSize issues and SF&F came together in 2000 when I edited Meisha Merlin Publishing\'s first original anthology, *Such A Pretty Face: Tales of Power and Abundance*. Most recently, I edited an anthology of science fiction, fantasy, and related genre stories about the \"world\'s oldest profession\" titled *The Ladies of Trade Town*.\r\nI\'m a warrior by several definitions. Human and civil rights activist, accessibility activist, political activist, and someone not afraid to \"call \'em as I see \'em\". More literally, I\'ve a fondness for sharp, pointy steel (I fence as a member of the SFWA Musketeers and the SCA) and firearms.\r\nAnd I\'m a Bard, Named - The Copper Bard - and sworn to traditional duties, some of which are acquitted in the above.\r\nI live in Texas with one husband of twenty-two years, and two cats.

	(151,'','Reinhardt Legacy Fight Team','We are a weapons demonstration team of former friends and students of swordsmanship authority Hank Reinhardt. The Reinhardt Legacy Fight Team started years ago as a casual group that regularly met with Hank at his house in Stone Mountain, GA during the 90s to spar. Later, some original members were in the Museum Replicas Ltd. Fight Team when he was director of MRL. Our purpose was to perform in sparring demonstrations. Two members have been in Hank\'s videos \"Viking Sword\" and \"Myth of the Sword\" as actors. Hank is gone now, but the friends Hank brought together have formed a team to promote \"The Book of Swords\". This final book has been published posthumously by his family.\r\nWe use the Gray Wolf as our logo in honor and memory of Hank. This was his heraldic device when he was active in the formative years of the SCA in the southern US. He was a key founder in the movement in the South. Later in life he went on to train and advise in print, video, and demonstrations. He was a key figure in launching the current, almost mainstream level of interest in swords in North America by being the first to provide usable arms that the average enthusiast could afford. Hank opened his home and knowledge to us in our youth. We are not unique in this, many people who knew Hank have had similar experiences. We are continuing to entertain, inform, spar, cut, and test new theories.\r\nWe demonstrate the use of classical weapons with cutting demonstrations and full contact sparring. Hank\'s philosophy was that fighting for your life requires ruthless efficiency. Our group has an aim at realism, eclipsed by needs for safety. Fairness does not figure in this equation. This attitude is out of keeping with some sport fighting organizations, but Hank was adamant about learning to fight, not learning sport. We do not promote any culture, era, or weapon above others. We evaluate the weapons and methods based on utility. Testing them in the contexts they were conceived, and in hypothetical situations, both modern and ancient. Hank loved to experiment and designed several fantasy swords that have no historical counterpart, but are very funtional. Hank enjoyed innovating new techniques with ancient weapons as well as taking what was useful from historical fechtbooks, but always with an eye for the practical. This was life and death afterall.\r\n(Taken from <a href=\'http://www.reinhardtlegacyfightteam.com/\'>The Fight Team\'s official page</A>)','','Performer',12),

It all began in a dark and dreary basement in Madison, Wisconsin, where he started out as a lowly slav... intern for James Frenkel. By the time he left four years later, the offices had been transplanted to a bright and cheery attic. While there Minz worked in a wide variety of capacities--mostly as an editorial assistant, literary agent and packager of anthologies, including co-packager of the highly regarded annual The Year\'s Best Fantasy and Horror edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling (at least it was still Windling at that time).\nIn September 1997, the siren song of the New York City publishing scene was simply too strong to resist, and he joined the editorial staff of Tom Doherty Associates (i.e. Tor, Forge, Orb, etc.) as David Hartwell\'s assistant. After several years of working on way too many books in way too small a window of time, he had accumulated enough of a list of his own authors to justify his very own job as a full Editor. Coffee, cake and scotch ensued. After they were all gone, there was nothing left to do but join the other German publishing empire, so on January 31, 2005, Herr Minz joined the editorial staff of Del Rey Books of the Random House Publishing Group (i.e. he moved from Holtzbrinck to Bertelsmann). After a couple years with the largest publishing company in the US, it was time to move on.\nSo on the centennial of Heinlein\'s birth, Minz joined Baen Books as Senior Editor. And he has been there ever since...\nAuthors he has worked with include Catherine Asaro, Hal Duncan, Eric Flint, Terry Goodkind, Elizabeth Haydon, Nancy Kress, Elizabeth Moon, Frederik Pohl, John Ringo, Robert J. Sawyer, Travis S. Taylor, Harry Turtledove, Mark Van Name, David Weber, Jack Williamson, Gene Wolfe, and Timothy Zahn among many, many others.\nFor more information, here is a link to an interview:  http://baen.com/Interviews/intMinz.htm.','','Editor',12);
